  <h1>Ryan Eaton</h1>
  <p><strong>Empowering communication. Supporting clarity. Solving problems.</strong></p>

  <h2>Communication Support</h2>
  <p>I help people communicate with more ease, confidence, and clarity — whether that means supporting Deaf clients, neurodiverse individuals, or anyone struggling to express themselves. From lipreading insight to simplifying everyday conversations, I make sure you feel seen, heard, and understood.</p>

  <h2>Tech Guidance</h2>
  <p>Tech doesn’t have to be stressful. I offer calm, clear support to help you understand, use, and feel confident with technology — without the jargon. Whether it's setting up devices or explaining apps in plain English, I break it down to what matters to you.</p>

  <h2>Everyday Support</h2>
  <p>Not everyone needs a coach or a mentor — sometimes you just need someone grounded, capable, and clear. I help people make sense of things, take action, and feel more in control of their day-to-day lives. No pressure. No fluff. Just straight-up, practical support.</p>
