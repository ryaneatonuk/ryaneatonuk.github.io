      <h2><span class="icon">üí¨</span>Communication Support ‚Äî Empowering, Clear, Human</h2>
      <p>I help people feel more confident and understood in how they express themselves and connect with others. Whether you‚Äôre Deaf, neurodiverse, shy, or just feeling lost in the noise, I offer grounded, one-to-one support to help you communicate more clearly ‚Äî through lipreading tips, body language, or basic BSL. It‚Äôs not about scripts or theory, it‚Äôs about real communication that works for you.</p>

      <h2><span class="icon">üñ•Ô∏è</span>Tech Support ‚Äî Calm, Friendly, Hassle-Free</h2>
      <p>If tech stresses you out, you‚Äôre not alone. I offer calm, no-jargon support for everyday tech ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs setting up your phone, tweaking your laptop, or helping you feel more in control of your digital world. I‚Äôve been around tech my whole life, and I know how to make it feel simpler, more human, and less overwhelming. No upselling, no pressure ‚Äî just honest help.</p>

      <h2><span class="icon">üîß</span>Everyday Support ‚Äî Real-World Guidance, Your Way</h2>
      <p>Not everyone needs a coach, a mentor, or a teacher. Most people just need someone calm, capable, and clear ‚Äî someone who can help them make sense of things and feel more in control. Whether it‚Äôs tackling day-to-day life, understanding a system, or gaining the confidence to speak up or try something new, I offer grounded support rooted in real experience. No jargon. No pressure. Just solid, practical help that actually fits your life.</p>
