      <h2>üí¨ Communication Support</h2>
      <p>If you're struggling to express yourself or feeling unheard ‚Äî I‚Äôve got you. Whether you're Deaf, neurodiverse, or just not sure how to say what you mean, I help you find your voice in a way that works for *you*. From lipreading know-how to body language and clear everyday conversations, this is support that actually listens. It's not about being perfect ‚Äî it's about being understood.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üñ•Ô∏è Tech Support</h2>
      <p>Tech doesn‚Äôt have to be a headache. If your phone, laptop or account settings feel overwhelming, I‚Äôll walk you through it calmly and clearly ‚Äî no jargon, no pressure, no upsell. I‚Äôve grown up with tech, and I know how to make it less stressful and more human. Just clear help that puts you back in control.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üîß Everyday Support</h2>
      <p>Life doesn‚Äôt always come with instructions. If things feel confusing, or you just want someone on your side to make sense of it all, I offer honest, grounded support that meets you where you‚Äôre at. No lectures, no labels ‚Äî just someone you can rely on to help you get unstuck, feel more in control, and move forward.</p>
