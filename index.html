    <h3>Communication Support — Empowering, Clear, Human</h3>
    <p>
      I help people feel more confident and understood in how they express themselves and connect with others. Whether you’re Deaf, neurodiverse, shy, or just feeling lost in the noise, I offer grounded, one-to-one support to help you communicate more clearly — through lipreading tips, body language, or basic BSL. It’s not about scripts or theory, it’s about real communication that works for you.

    <h3>Tech Support — Calm, Friendly, Hassle-Free</h3>
    <p>
      If tech stresses you out, you’re not alone. I offer calm, no-jargon support for everyday tech — whether it’s setting up your phone, tweaking your laptop, or helping you feel more in control of your digital world. I’ve been around tech my whole life, and I know how to make it feel simpler, more human, and less overwhelming. No upselling, no pressure — just honest help.

    <h3>Everyday Support — Real-World Guidance, Your Way</h3>
    <p>
      Not everyone needs a coach, a mentor, or a teacher. Most people just need someone calm, capable, and clear — someone who can help them make sense of things and feel more in control. Whether it’s tackling day-to-day life, understanding a system, or gaining the confidence to speak up or try something new, I offer grounded support rooted in real experience. No jargon. No pressure. Just solid, practical help that actually fits your life.
